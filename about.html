                    Hey everybody! My name is Elliott, and I'm a 26 year old software developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University,
                    where I graduated from in 2015.  I currently develop CPQ software by day for a large company in the Phoenix area.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But by night, I stream Fortnite Battle Royale!
                    I'm currently in the top 1% of Xbox players, with a consistent 20% solo win rate, and a love for the game that no other has given me until now.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm originally from the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, and lived there until I left for college.  Since then, my parents have retired to a lake
                    in Southern Missouri, so that's now the place I call home.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have a loving girlfriend of over four years, and together we have a Australian Shephard / Border Collie mix named Clover who is almost 2 years
                    old.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Friends and family always come first for me, but my passion is gaming.  I've been a gamer since I could hold a controller, and literally some of
                    my earliest memories are of the Super Nintendo.  My dad bought me an N64 when it launched, when I was 4 years old, and I grew up playing games as
                    much as I could.  Mario Kart 64 and GoldenEye were probably the first two games I was actually good at, and GoldenEye started my love of shooters.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I've always been a console gamer, and I've always loved seeing games progress throughout my life.  Being born in the '90s, I've seen technology explode
                    at a ridiculous rate, and have done my best to keep up with the latest and greatest tech.  Competition between the corporate giants drives this
                    progress, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the years to come.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I don't discriminate when it comes to consoles, PC, or gaming genres.  I've played it all.  My love of FPS titles surged with the release of Halo: CE,
                    knocking heads in basement LAN parties with my friends.  RuneScape was my first MMO, where I ran an active clan for years with hundreds of members,
                    venturing into the Wilderness.  I graduated to World of Warcraft, and was a top-ranked Warrior on my server in a large Raiding guild.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I had my days in League of Legends, maining Riven or Renekton top lane, getting carried in Competitive play by top-ranked friends.  Since then, with money
                    being tight at the time, my PC gaming turned more casual with many indie titles on Steam, along with countless hours of Minecraft.  I even played some text-based
                    games, including Kings of Chaos, where I fought across many Ages and became a consistent front-page finisher.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But I always had consoles, where I lived for the shooting genre as well as racing games.  Call of Duty was big for me in high school, but my attention turned
                    to the Battlefield series with the launch of Bad Company.  Battlefield quickly became my favorite shooter, and I spent thousands of hours in game all the way
                    through Battlefield 1.  At DICE's pace and with the release of Battlefield V coming up, I doubt another shooter can dethrone my current standing FPS favorite.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It was with Battlefield 4 that I began streaming, under the handle SunDevil Dreiak, simply using my Xbox One to cast directly to Twitch in 720p in 30fps.
                    Since then, I have advanced to a high quality stream pumping out 1080p content at 60fps, with streaming hardware and software, overlays, and a small
                    community that supports me.  You can check out exactly what equipment I use on the

                <br>
                <p>
                    Other titles I've loved in my time gaming include The Witcher, The Legend of Zelda, Destiny, Overwatch, Battlefront, RocketLeague, Forza, The Elder Scrolls and
                    Fallout, Elite: Dangerous, Mass Effect, and many more!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I look forward to the future of gaming and any role I can play in it.  I do this becausse I love it, and I hope to spread a bit of that to all of my viewers
                    and supporters.  Come hang out with me for some Victory Royales!
